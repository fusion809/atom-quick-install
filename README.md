# Atom Quick Installer
This repository contains shell scripts for installing Atom on a variety of different Linux distributions, using the official binary releases of Atom. This is as opposed to my [atom-installer](https://github.com/fusion809/atom-installer) repository, which by default will build Atom from source and then install it. This repository only works on 64-bit Linux platforms.
