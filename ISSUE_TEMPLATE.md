### Prerequisites
Please include the following information:

* The Linux distribution you are using, including its version. For example, I am typing this issue template on Ubuntu 16.04, so if I experienced an error on this platform I would mention that I am running Ubuntu 16.04.
* The architecture of your system (which you can find by running `uname -m`).
